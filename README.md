# content_swapper_plugin
A chrome plugin that allows you to swap content (text and/or images) between web pages. because why not?

# Installation
um, I think the same way you install any chrome plugin. But you need to install it locally, this isn't in the chrome plugin "store"

# Warnings
This doesn't do anything until you start cliking the buttons in the plugin. But once you do that, the content in the page you're on will get all messed up. That's on purpose, because it's art. But restart your browser before doing anything "real" online.
