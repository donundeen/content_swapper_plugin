# content_swapper_plugin
A chrome plugin that allows you to swap content (text and/or images) between web pages. because why not?

# Installation
um, I think the same way you install any chrome plugin. But you need to install it locally, this isn't in the chrome plugin "store"

## To install from this repo:
- Download the zip file content_swapper_plugin.zip (under CODE->Download Zip), or just download/clone this whole repo
- if you just downloaded the zip file, unzip it somewhere you'll keep it (personally I use the Documents folder)
- in Chrome Menu, go to "Window->Extensions"
- click "Load Unpacked"
- select the content_swapper_plugin FOLDER (not the zip file)
- If the system asks you to approve some permissions, go ahead and approve them
- The plugin SHOULD then appear in your list of extensions. 
- There's a toggle switch in the lower right of the box. Make sure it's ACTIVE/ON/BLUE

## Pin to URL bar
- to the right of the URL, there should be an icon that looks like a puzzle piece. Hover over it and it says "Extensions" Click on it.
- in the menu that drops down, you should see "Pointless Web Content Swapper"
- next to that there should be an icon that looks like a pushpin. ðŸ“Œ 
- if it's grey, click it so it turns blue
- Now you should see a ðŸ’¥ emoji to the right of your url bar.

# USAGE
- click on the ðŸ’¥  and you'll have a dropdown menu of 4 actions (hover over the icon to see the action text)
-- "suck up text" : This copies all the text from the webpage you're on into the extensions memory. Do this BEFORE you do "swap out text." THEN go to another Page.
-- "swap out text" : This REPLACES all the text on the current page with whatever is in the extension's memory.
-- "suck up images" : This copies all the image urls from the webpage you're on into the extensions memory. Do this BEFORE you do "swap out images." THEN go to another Page.
-- "swap out images" : This REPLACES all the image urls on the current page with whatever is in the extension's memory.

# Warnings and caveats
- This doesn't do anything until you start cliking the buttons in the plugin. But once you do that, the content in the page you're on will get all messed up. That's on purpose, because it's art. But restart your browser before doing anything "real" online.
- This extension depends on web pages doing things "normally." So it won't work on all pages. You'll have to experiment a bit.
